(e.g. if in a recipe appears a ingredient of meat , the recipe has to be excluded from vegetarian/vegan/fruitarian recipe. )

2-   * <= the rating <= *****

3- during the sign in phase the user must complete a captcha for avoiding bot 

4- 4-level difficulty : 
	* -> easy
	** -> normal
	*** -> hard
	**** -> extreme

5- A matrix for transforming the different unity of measure due to the different expression of them

(e.g  from teaspoon to ml , from pieces to grams )
